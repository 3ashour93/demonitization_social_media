### Purpose

The purpose of this piece is to investigate how to disarm polarization by showing when advertising and influencers powers are removed from the social media sphere, there can be a way to reach mutual agreements and can generate a healthier argumentative environment.

## Findings

In this figure, we are simulating how social media with influencers and advertising can cause 'polarization'. The diagram reaches equilibrium when we let each side alone 'convince' one another without outside interference. 
This is noticed when we add on the side that is Pro or the side that is Against.

Outside forces are labeled as Influencers or Advertising whose main aim is to pull one side towards the other, thus causing polarization (based on our paper) / unbalanced graph in our example. 

We notice an unbalanced result when we add more 'influence' from 'advertising' or 'influencers'. When we increase 'Neutral Users', they will tend to be pulled towards the advertisements / influencers, and thus adding towards the polarization. 

It is important to note that social media is much more complex than such a diagram. This is the case for one argument only for the sake of simplicity. We can assume that social media can be in a form of a set of multiple such diagrams on different conversations and points of view. 

However, based on such model, it also explains that for us to have an 'unpolarized' and 'healthy' social media, we will need to demonetize it. Thus removing the external forces that affect its users.
